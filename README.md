DISCLAIMER
This project's core functionality was first developed within a 4-5 hours, from 1AM to 5-6AM of July 12st, I made this map tool just because I love Pokémon, but things got out of control and after 3 days of go live, the map was receiving 30k visitors per day. This forced me to develop in a must-fix-everything way instead of focusing on the application architecure. So, the backend is ok, but the frontend is terrible HAHA, I appreciate if anyone can help on fixing the front end flaws and helping me improve this map even more :)
