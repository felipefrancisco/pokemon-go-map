DISCLAIMER
This project's core functionality was first developed within a 4-5 hours, from 1AM to 5-6AM of July 12st, I made this map tool
just because I love Pokémon, but things got out of control and after 3 days of go live, the map was receiving 30k visitors per
day. After that, I've spend lots of hours during the night developing like crazy to get things working properly and creating 
new features, that's why things can look terrible (mostly on the front-end). I was planning to use AngularJS to control everything
but the controllers are not following the rules of good development of angular for reasons that: I needed to create and fix things quickly, so, the first thing that solved the problem was ok for me at that moment HAHA.

I appreciate if anyone can help on fixing the front end flaws and helping me improve this map even more :)
